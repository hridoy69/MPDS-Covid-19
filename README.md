# MPDS-COVID-19
Molecular Property Diagnostic Suite (MPDS) was conceived and developed as an open-source
disease-specific web portal based on Galaxy. MPDSCOVID-19 was developed for COVID-19 as a onestop
solution for drug discovery research. Galaxy platforms enable the creation of customized
workflows connecting various modules in the web server. The architecture of MPDSCOVID-19
effectively employs Galaxy v22.04 features, which are ported on CentOS 7.8 and Python 3.7.
MPDSCOVID-19 provides significant updates and the addition of several new tools updated after
six years. Tools developed by our group in Perl/Python and open-source tools are collated and
integrated into MPDSCOVID-19 using XML scripts. Our MPDS suite aims to facilitate transparent and
open innovation. This approach significantly helps bring inclusiveness in the community while
promoting free access and participation in software development.
# Availability & Implementation:
